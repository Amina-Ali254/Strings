#  Strings Basics
#  1) Strings are sequence of charachters that are enclosed in either single quote ('') or double qoute ("").
#  2) In Python, strings are immutable, which means that once a string is created, it cannot be modified.


#  Basic Operations and Functions
# 1) Concatenation: It is the process of combining two and more strings together. This can be done using the '+' operator.

string1 = 'Hello'
String2 = "World"
string3 = string1 + " " + String2
